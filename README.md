**Want to contribute?**
Visit [colornames.org](https://colornames.org/) and provide some names or vote for colors to improve this package!
If you find any issues or have ideas for improvements, don't hesitate to [create an issue in the GitHub repository](https://github.com/marcelgarus/colorz/issues/new).

**Updates of the package:**
From time to time, I'll re-generate the `Colorz` and upload a major version upgrade to pub.dev (because there may be incompatibilities with former versions).
If you want to generate the `Colorz` yourself, go into the root directory of the [<kbd>colorz</kbd>](https://github.com/marcelgarus/colorz) package and run `dart generator/generator.dart`.
