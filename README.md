You're creating an app and trying out different `Colors`? A little `Colors.green`, or `Colors.blue`, maybe even `Colors.pink`?
There are so much more colors you're missing out on!

üé® On [colornames.org](https://colornames.org/) people from all over the word come together to name colors.
This package makes the million most upvoted colors available in your Flutter app! That's the best 5.9‚Äâ% of all 16.7‚Äâmillion RGB colors!

Join the fun and say hello to `Colorz.expiredStrawberryMilkshake`, `Colorz.unoReverseCardYellow` and `Colorz.radioactiveBooger`!
Make use of `Colorz.anAlmostPinkRed`, `Colorz.minecraftChest` and `Colorz.itsStillBasicallyBlack`!
Meet `Colorz.sweetMustard`, `Colorz.toothpaste` and `Colorz.fadedCactus`!

The color names are chosen by the community and are not censored. Therefore, color names may include words considered offensive, vulgar or obscene by typical users.

From time to time, I'll re-generate the `Colorz` and upload the new colors as a major version upgrade to pub.dev (because there may be incompatibilities between former versions).
If you want to generate colors yourself, go into the root directory of the <kbd>colors</kbd> package and run `dart generator/generator.dart`.
