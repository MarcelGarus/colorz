There are so many more inspiring colors you're missing out on!

üé® On [colornames.org](https://colornames.org/) people from all over the word come together to name colors.
This package makes the 9.000 most upvoted colors available in your Flutter app!
That's the best [0.0536‚Äâ%](https://www.google.com/search?q=9000%2F256%5E3) of all 16.7‚Äâmillion RGB colors!

‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer:**
The color names are chosen by the community and are not censored. Therefore, color names may include words considered offensive, vulgar or obscene.

‚ù§Ô∏è **Want to contribute?**
Visit [colornames.org](https://colornames.org/) and provide some names or vote for colors to improve this package!
If you find any issues or have ideas for improvements of this package, don't hesitate to [create an issue in the GitHub repository](https://github.com/marcelgarus/colorz/issues/new).

üì¶ **Updates of this package:**
From time to time, I'll re-generate the `Colorz` and upload a major version upgrade to [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/) (because there may be incompatibilities with previous versions).
If you want to generate the `Colorz` yourself, go into the root directory of the [<kbd>colorz</kbd>](https://github.com/marcelgarus/colorz) package and run `dart generator/generator.dart`.

ü§î **Why only use the top 9.000 colors and not something round, like the top 10.000?**
[pub.dev](https://pub.dev/) runs dartdoc with limited space.
